A React + TypeScript + Bootstrap based shopping cart with the ability to add and remove items, calculate the final sum, and erase the entire cart. State is saved to LocalStorage and perstist on refresh.

Plans for the future:
1.Refactor the code and get rid of the inline styles.
2.Add memoization to ShoppingCartContext.tsx.
3.Get rid of 'any' types and resolve any eslint errors.
4.Add functionalty to add new items.
5.Add switching to Russian language
